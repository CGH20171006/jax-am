Notes
=====

For educational purpose, we will post notes on several topics. We have already implemented most of these methods with JAX.

* Discrete Element Method (DEM)

  * :download:`A short description on DEM <../notes/DEM.pdf>`

* Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)

* Phase Field Method (PFM)

* Finite Element Method (FEM)

  * :download:`A note on crystal plasticity <../notes/CPFEM.pdf>`

* Differential Equation Constrained Optimization
