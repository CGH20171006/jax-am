# Quick Start

The typical workflow contains two major steps:
1. Generate a polycrystal structure and mesh it (with Neper)
2. Perform phase-field simulation.

The file  `jax-am/jax_am/phase_field/example.py` is an instructive example. To run this file, under root directory (`jax-am/`) and run

```
python -m jax_am.phase_field.example
```

Please see the comments in  `jax-am/jax_am/phase_field/example.py` for further details.
