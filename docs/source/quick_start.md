# Quick Start


Install JAX-AM by

```
pip install jax-am
```

Then refer to  `applications/` for a variety of examples. For example, run

```
python -m applications.phase_field.simple.example
```
from the root directory will run an application of the phase-field method with a simple example.


We will build (much) better documentation in the future. Stay tuned!
