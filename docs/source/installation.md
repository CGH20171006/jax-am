# Install

Before installing JAX-AM, please ensure that you have an updated and upgraded pip version.

JAX-AM is on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/jax-am/) so you can install it by

```bash
pip install jax-am
```

To install the most updated version from github, you can run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tianjuxue/jax-am.git
cd jax-am
pip install .
```

Note: if you want to install JAX-AM in editable mode, e.g., for code development on your local machine, run
```bash
pip install --editable .
```

>**Note**: JAX-AM depends on JAX. If you want to use GPU, you need to first [install the GPU version of JAX](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) properly.

>**Note**: If you want to use the phase-field package of JAX-AM, [Neper](https://neper.info/) is required for polycrystal generation.
